To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC-20\n applications."

Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"notice\":\"VoiceWallet \\u30c6\\u30b9\\u30c8\\u7528\\u306e\\u6700\\u5c0f ERC20 \\u30e2\\u30c3\\u30af\",\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/mocks/MockERC20.sol\":\"MockERC20\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1b88b3fb3d85ba5496d7d5f396f83ee1fddcdd6762059ff65992655b67920998\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://89393bb3212da1c0889601b9706a07b39419ddc4d2faab9eaf6e7f9152cf6a1c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcCfzzxv1Bkdz1c1yF4gQCeYb6Us5BJANnzTFqawfd1HL\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x669464167428061ee0f8618b73b3ee90aff8405683e7ddde8cd77dadaa1afe29\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0dda78587a7358b4fdf6b9fca0fde5a5e34930f36d5268a16028627fc0170195\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQ1b6cCceDRWNxti9HifsTCzmVP25Haxs1bWugm52vTqH\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x74ed01eb66b923d0d0cfe3be84604ac04b76482a55f9dd655e1ef4d367f95bc2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5282825a626cfe924e504274b864a652b0023591fa66f06a067b25b51ba9b303\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeCfPykghhMc81VJTrHTC7sF6CRvaA1FXVq2pJhwYp1dV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd6fa4088198f04eef10c5bce8a2f4d60554b7ec4b987f684393c01bf79b94d9f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f95ee0bbd4dd3ac730d066ba3e785ded4565e890dbec2fa7d3b9fe3bad9d0d6e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSLr6bHkPFWT7ntj34jmwfyskpwo97T9jZUrk5sz3sdtR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"contracts/mocks/MockERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5131b98fc57b9f5a388be65b091f7b594388cc8120bf32e392b7f0f0eba0fcbb\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://4944a03f90c0d63bf784deed45803cf62c851219e5a907d5c11e188d2e17403c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmctUG4aHp8vs8MYL8YFQidwwgPCDoExeuXXaGFpRUr3QU\"]}},\"version\":1}"
